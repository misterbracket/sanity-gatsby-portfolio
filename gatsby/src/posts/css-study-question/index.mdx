## Fundamentals

- What is a declaration in CSS?
- What is a property in CSS?
- How does `:focus` work?
- How does `:active` work?
- How does `:checked` work?
- What does HSL stand for? What do the values stand for?
- Can you write a HSL color declaration with transparency?
- What does the `em` tag do?
- What is the prefered unit for typography and why?
- What is the prefered unit for width and height and why?
- What is the prefered unit for margin, padding and border?
- What is the prefered unit for color?
- What happens if you use `font-style: bold`? What happens if you use the corresponding number instead? What happens if you did not provide a e.g. 700 weight character set for your font?
- What should be a good value for contrast ratio?

## Rendering Logic I

- How is CSS inheritance like prototypal inheritance?
- What properties are naturally i√ßnherited?
- Can a property that is inherited be overwritten by the users-agent stylesheet of a browser? Eg. color
- How can you force inheritance?
- What does the _cascading_ in CSS mean?
- Is cascading still relevant in modern web development? If yes, in which way?
- What is cardinality?
- What is the box model? What are the four elements?

  ```html
  <style>
    section {
      width: 500px;
    }
    .box {
      width: 100%;
      padding: 20px;
      border: 4px solid;
    }
  </style>
  <section>
    <div class="box"></div>
  </section>
  ```

- By default how is the total width of an element calculated? In the example above: what will ultimately be the width and the height of the element?
- What option does the box-sizing property take? What is the difference?
- Does margin have an effect on boxsizing?

  ```css
  .something {
    width: 400px;
    height: 150px;
    padding-bottom: 50%;
  }
  ```

- What does padding-block do? Where does padding-inline set the padding? Where does padding-inline-start set the padding?
- What is the difference between outline and border?
- What does `margin: auto` do? How is this behaviour similar to `width: auto`?
- What is the behaviour when you set the height or the width of a `display: inline` element?
  - What are the exceptions?
- What is the default width behaviour?
- What does `width: 100%` and `margin: 32px` do on a block level element?
- What does `width: min-content`, `width: max-content`, `width: fit-content` do?
- What are the rules for margin collapse? When do margins of elements collapse?
