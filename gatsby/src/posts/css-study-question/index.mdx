## Fundamentals

- What is a declaration in CSS?

- What is the prefered unit for typography and why?
- What is the prefered unit for width and height and why?
- What is the prefered unit for margin, padding and border?
- What is the prefered unit for color?
- What happens if you use `font-style: bold`? What happens if you use the corresponding number instead? What happens if you did not provide a e.g. 700 weight character set for your font?

## Rendering Logic I

- How is CSS inheritance like prototypal inheritance?
- What properties are inherited by default?
- Can a property that is inherited be overwritten by the users-agent stylesheet of a browser (e.g. color)?
- How can you force inheritance?
- What does the _cascading_ in CSS mean?
- Is cascading still relevant in modern web development? If yes, in which way?
- What is cardinality?
- What is the box model? What are the four elements?

```html
<style>
  section {
    width: 500px;
  }
  .box {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 20px;
    border: 4px solid;
  }
</style>
<section>
  <div class="box"></div>
</section>
```

- By default how is the total width of an element calculated? In the example above: what will ultimately be the width and the height of the element?
- What option does the box-sizing property take? What is the difference?
- Does margin have an effect on boxsizing?

```css
.something {
  width: 400px;
  height: 150px;
  padding-bottom: 50%;
}
```

- What is the difference with moving elements with margin and with position?
- How do percentages work in `position: absolute`?

- What is the issue when children have the `position: absolute` property set? What is the height of the containg element?
- What is the width of a `position: absolute` element that is display block?
