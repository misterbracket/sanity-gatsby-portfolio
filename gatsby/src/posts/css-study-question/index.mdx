## Fundamentals

- What is a declaration in CSS?
- What is a property in CSS?
- How does `:focus` work?
- How does `:active` work?
- How does `:checked` work?
- What does HSL stand for? What do the values stand for?
- Can you write a HSL color declaration with transparency?
- What does the `em` tag do?
- What is the prefered unit for typography and why?
- What is the prefered unit for width and height and why?
- What is the prefered unit for margin, padding and border?
- What is the prefered unit for color?
- What happens if you use `font-style: bold`? What happens if you use the corresponding number instead? What happens if you did not provide a e.g. 700 weight character set for your font?
- What should be a good value for contrast ratio?

## Rendering Logic I

- How is CSS inheritance like prototypal inheritance?
- What properties are inherited by default?
- Can a property that is inherited be overwritten by the users-agent stylesheet of a browser (e.g. color)?
- How can you force inheritance?
- What does the _cascading_ in CSS mean?
- Is cascading still relevant in modern web development? If yes, in which way?
- What is cardinality?
- What is the box model? What are the four elements?

```html
<style>
  section {
    width: 500px;
  }
  .box {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 20px;
    border: 4px solid;
  }
</style>
<section>
  <div class="box"></div>
</section>
```

- By default how is the total width of an element calculated? In the example above: what will ultimately be the width and the height of the element?
- What option does the box-sizing property take? What is the difference?
- Does margin have an effect on boxsizing?

```css
.something {
  width: 400px;
  height: 150px;
  padding-bottom: 50%;
}
```

- What does `padding-block` do? Where does `padding-inline` set the padding? Where does `padding-inline-start` set the padding?
- What is the difference between outline and border?
- What does `margin: auto` do? How is this behaviour similar to `width: auto`?
- What is the behaviour when you set the height or the width of a `display: inline` element?
  - What are the exceptions?
- What is the default width behaviour?
- What does `width: 100%` and `margin: 32px` do on a block level element?
- What does `width: min-content`, `width: max-content`, `width: fit-content` do?
- What are the rules for margin collapse? When do margins of elements collapse?

## Rendering Logic II

- What is the point of positioned Layout (as in `position: absolute|fixed|relative`)?
- What is the default position?
- What does `position: relative` do?
- What is the difference with moving elements with margin and with position?
- How do percentages work in `position: absolute`?
- What effect has `position: absolute` on layout?
- What is the issue when children have the `position: absolute` property set? What is the height of the containg element?
- What is the width of a `position: absolute` element that is display block?
- Is it better to use margins or padding elements that have the property `position: absolute`? Why would you want to use margins and paddings anyway?
- What happens if you set all four items on a `position: absolute` element (top, bottom, left, right)?
- How can you center a modal in the middle of the screen (with `position: absolute`)?
- How does a `position: absolute` element get contained so that it does not automatically jump to the edge of the screen?
- What happens if you just set an item to `position: absolute` without the any directions (top, bottom, left right)?
- How does a `position: absolute` element get contained so that it does not automatically jump to the edge of the screen?
- In a stack of overlapping elements which item renders on top without using z-index or positioned layout?
- What is a stacking context?
- What happens if one element is styled with positioned layout? How will it change the default behaviour of the browser?
- What is the main way to create a stacking context?
- What are other ways to create stacking contexts?
- Can you contain a `position: fixed` element with a wrapping `position: relative`?
- In some cases a CSS property on an ancestor will interfere with how a `position: fixed` element is contained. What is the exception for positioning elements with fixed?
- Can you implement a model also with `position: fixed`? What will be the difference to `position: absolute` modal?
- What is the difference between `overflow: scroll` and `overflow: auto`?
- What is the use case of `overflow: hidden`?
- What is the use case of `overflow: hidden`?
- How can you overflow: hidden an overflowing `position: absolute` element?
- `position: sticky` means that there is a transition between two values the the position property. Which one?
- Does `position: sticky` take up space in the layout or is it like `position: absolute`?
- How to contain a `position: sticky` element?
- What does `top: 50px` do on a `position: sticky` element?
- What does `top: -50px` do on a `position: sticky` element?
- What will prevent `position: sticky` to work?
- What is the difference between `visibility: hidden` and `display: none` and `opacity: 0`?

## Modern Component Architecture

- What does the revert value do (e.g `text-decoration: revert`)?
- How can you select all the elements except for the first one in a list?
- What is the native HTML element to create a progress bar?
- If you have to make a Progress Bar accessible, how would you do it?

## FlexBox

- How does cardinality and Flexbox relate?
- What is the primary axis? What is the cross axis? How can you flip it?
- What is the default size of a flex item? The parent only has `display: flex` applied and a fixed height and width.
- What does `align-items: baseline` do?
- What is the minimum width that an item can become? <strong>Hint:</strong> What would be the corresponding width value? What would overflow? The container or the items?
- What does `flex-basi`s do?
- If an item has both flex-basis and a height set, who your win? Assume the parent has the property `flex-direction: column`.
- What does `flex-grow` do? What happen to a set `flex-basi`s on the same element?
- What does `flex-shrink` do? What happen to a set `flex-basi`s on the same element?
- What does `flex: 1` do? To what will `flex-basi`s be set?
- How can you constrain an elements size after applying `flex-grow` or `flex-shrink` on it? Does it make sense to constrain the height and the width? When can it become problematic constraining the height?
- How can you control when a flex row should wrap? How can you control the size of the items that goes into the next line?
- What is the difference between `align-items` and `justify-content` (in FlexBox)?
- What does `align-content :center` do? Under what condition is it useful? What is the difference to `align-items`?
- What does `gap: 30px` do?
- What is the "magic space" for images? Why is it there? How can we fix it?
- How does the `order` property work on flex children?
- What does the `tab-index` attribute on a HTML element do?
- What happens if layout modes crash? E.g. what happens if an element is a flex item and has a `position: fixed` property?
- What about relative positioning?
- What about margin collapse?
- How do FlexBox and z-index interact with each other?
