I implemented the React library from scratch by only using 200-300 lines of code. I also implemented hooks as closures (see [my blog post about React hooks and closures](https://maxklammer.com/blog/react-hooks-and-closures/) ). The coolest thing is that I also implemented **Concurrent React**, which is one of the major updates to React that is going to be released in React 18.

**Note**: This is all heavily inspired by veterans of the industry, especially by [Rodrigo Pombo](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) and [Swyx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeyiA9U8Ep8). Check out their original content for more details.

## Implemented Components

- **JSX**: You can just use the Babel preset and run it in your build job to take JSX and convert it into objects.
- **Create HTML Elements from JSX:** Once the JSX has been transformed we need to update some functions that create the Elements on the DOM should I need it.
- **React Fiber:** We need to recreate the React fiber architecture (which is basically a [linked list data structure](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/linked_list_algorithms.htm)) in order to efficiently recurse over all React fiber elements and to traverse back to the root.
- **Work Loop:** In order not to block the main thread we need a work loop that executes a unit of work every time the main thread is idle. We can do that by using the `requestIdleCallback` function of the browser.
- **Reconciliation:** We need a process that checks if the component should re-render or not. Basically, we are comparing our internal state, with the state of the DOM and re-render the nodes that have changed. Note that in the `alternate` property we store the previous “state” of the fiber. Like this, we can check if it has changed.
- **Batch Updating:** We do not update the DOM on every change, rather we calculate the changes beforehand and then commit to the DOM.
- **`useState` hook**: In order to have some re-renders and to update the DOM.
- **`useEffect` hook**: Fetch some Pokemon over an API and update the state. Run the hook based on dependencies.

## Notes:

There are essentially three main parts to the logic:

- The work loop starts the reconciliation process and works on it whenever the main thread is idle. Once all fibers have been created/updated we commit all the work to the DOM.
- The reconciliation process that creates the fibers and updates the fibers should something change.
  - Loops through all the fibers (performUnitOfWork)
- The commit phase loops over the previously created fibers and creates the DOM.
- Creates, updates and deletes the fibers based on the effect tag.
