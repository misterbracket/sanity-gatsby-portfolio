# Be your own coach

Every professional is in charge of his own career. I think that when you load of your development to your manager you are doing yourself a disservice. At the end of the day, do you really want to leave it to someone else to manage your progress and your career. This is how I started planning my journey and so far I am very happy with it.

I left left collage behind me in 2016. With starry blue eyes I started my first job, thinking that if I just do my job that will be enough to progress my career. Eagerly I did my job and waited for my performance review to discuss how I can progress in the company, how I can develop my career further and work on my personal development plan. I waited and waited, but this talk never came. My boss at the time was held up in a huge project and was not able to take the time to work with me on these things.

This was difficult for me as I was not yet experienced enough to really take ownership of my development plan. Frankly, I needed someone to tell me what the next step should be for me. I was not prepared for this as even at my time at the university the next step was always predetermined. After class A, follows class B and so on and so forth. This was the first time that I understood that I need to take ownership of my career and actively set time apart to manage it. In the end I know that I spend most of my time at work and I want to have a say in what I do with my time.

When you are a young professional entering the workforce you need mentorship and guidance from your seniors.
