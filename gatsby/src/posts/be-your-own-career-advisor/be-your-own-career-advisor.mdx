Every professional is in charge of his own career. In the last years I started to become much more proactive when it came to career decisions and I am much happier and more focused for it. This is how I started planning my journey in the professional world and how I learned to be more relaxed in the process.

## Why This Matters

I left left collage in 2016. I started my first job, thinking that if I just do what I am told well, it will be enough and I will automatically drift into a career that I will enjoy. In the following months I did my job and waited for my performance review to discuss how I can progress in the company I worked for at the time. I also hoped that the discussions with my manager would help me to find a bit more clarity what I wanted out of my career. In a perfect world, you will have a boss that goes over these things with you and who will make time for these discussions and prepare for them. the younger you are the more time he will take to work on your development. However, in my experience especially in the tech industry we often are faced with managers that are more concerned with Kernel Versions rather than doing people management. Managers in IT often come from a technical background and did not have the opportunity to formally learn the tools needed to be a good manager. I feel for many it is more of a habit where they keep doing what feels familiar to them. While I met some amazing managers, there are many that are too busy with day-to-day nuances instead of planning out the skillset of their team in the long term.

I remember that at the time I felt pretty uneasy. Truthfully, at the time I needed someone to tell me what my next step should be. I was not prepared for this as even at my time at university it was always clear what would be next: class A is followed by class B and so on and so forth. This was the first time that I understood that I need to take ownership of my career and actively set time apart to manage it. In the end I spend most of my waking time at work and I want to have a say in what I do with my time.

## My Process

What I decided to do is to take time some time for myself every 6 months and try to reflect myself on what I wanted to do going forward. I also take the opportunity to really reflect about the decisions I have taken in the last 6 months. While at first I reflected only on technical decisions I took in the past, I recently started to also include more soft skills (more on this later). Here is what I learned in the process.

## Identify Your Leaders

After deciding that I was going take on the challenge, I was immediately hit by a whirlwind of questions: What is a good goal to set? How often should I review these goals? Was the next step even worthwhile taking, since I still do not know where I want to end up? At the beginning these questions can be a bit overwhelming. If you are still a Junior as I was at the time you simply don't know what you don't know. What really helped me was to stop looking at my immediate surrounding for guidance and I started to look online. There is a whole world of dedicated professionals online that are leaders in their respective craft and share on a daily basis what they are doing, what they are exited by, the tools they are working with and so on. I found it really helpful to look at what what their definition of "good" and excellence is. It helped me a lot in breaking out of my small little world. Exposing myself to many different viewpoints also really helped me to find a niche in tech that I really enjoy working in and I started to form a vision of what viable options could be for me.

## Creating a List of Goals and Set Priorities

I work in tech, so forming a vision in which specific field I wanted to work, meant to have a long laundry list of tech that I apparently needed to learn. I think 90% of the technologies on my first draft are completely useless to me now, but I found the more I get a clearer picture of where I want to end up the more accurate this list becomes. I also moved away from thinking that I need to only learn technical things and certifications. As I continued my journey I realised that I have many other things that I need to learn to, like how to stand your ground in a discussion or how to deal with difficult team members or employees.

These days I try to set goals that are SMART (**S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant, **T**ime-bound). I try to really spend some time thinking about how this goal is benefitting me in the short term in one way or the other and try to very specific about what I want do. For example recently I wanted to become better as TypeScript. This on its own is not a good goal to set. What I actually wrote done was that I wanted to build a blog using TypeScript until end of June. This is much better as it gives me a clear goal and deadline. While you can argue that this still is not very specific it was enough to get me going on this journey, because I invested enough '"activation energy" to start my journey. Once I started it will become more fun and in the end there is no need to be too self serious about this and see how much you enjoy the project as you go.

**Bad goal:**

<Quote>Become better at TypeScript</Quote>

**Better goal:**

<Quote>Build a Blog using TypeScript and Gatsby in the next 6 months.</Quote>

Finally, I try to choose goals that I can actually influence. I stopped setting goals like: "I want to be promoted the end of the year". This really is not something I can influence. I sure can ask for it, but it is ultimately the decision of my company and my boss. What would be a better goal would be something along the lines of: "Schedule meeting to discuss a promotion." I can clearly work on this and this totally attainable.

## Reflect On What You Have Done

If there is one unexpected way in in which writing down my goals and experiences really benefited me was that it gave me a lot more peace of mind. The world of tech can be incredibly overwhelming and it feels like it gets more complex every day. There is virtually no limit to the things that you can start learning and you can easily loose track of things that you have learned already. I am a self taught developer so I always looked at the mountain with a an uneasy feeling. I was not sure how I was supposed to climb this mountain. At the end of the 6 months I collect my thought and think about what I have accomplished in the last 6 month. I figuratively turn around, look down into valley and just enjoy the process. This mountain of knowledge will never have a real top so at the end of the day this check-in with myself allows me to take a break and to "smell the roses along the way".

## Check In Regularly

Throughout the year between these check-ins with myself I come back to my list of goals in regular intervals. Undoubtedly, I will find other things that are more interesting in the moment and things that I would prefer spending my time on. This list does not mean that I cannot change course or change it during the year, but whenever I check my list of goals I am reminded that I spend a decent amount of time them my goal and prioritising them. The list of things I chose to work on is very curated and each item was chosen deliberately and with purpose. So if something more interesting comes up I will at least compare it to all the things that I thought at the time would be important when I started my six month cycle. In the end I frequently I toss away this new idea and stay the course, because I am reminded why I chose to work on this over something else.

## Feeling in Control

Ultimately, I enjoy feeling more in control of my journey. I know where the road is going to lead me. So what about my bosses? In my experience, all of the bosses I had so far really enjoyed the fact the I was taking more initiative. You can take the opportunity to approach him with your thoughts and you can then work together to plan how to reach your goal. In most cases he will be happy, because you are taking things off his plate and you are demonstrating that you are capable of actively take ownership.

## Conclusion

When I started this process I did not expect to stick to it for this long and now I have been doing it for five years now and it has become something I really look forward to. You can find these patterns of periodic reflection and feedback cycles all over and I wanted to apply this process to this area as well. While this might not be a perfect fit for everyone I really encourage you to take a step back and think about what do you want to achieve in the next 6 month and what you accomplished in the last six. I just hope that I will help you as much as it helped me.
